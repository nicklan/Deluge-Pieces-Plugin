## Description

This plugin adds a tab that will show the status of each piece of the
torrent.

There are three states for each piece: 
not downloaded (black), downloaded (red), or currently downloading (blue). 
These are indicated by color.

The plugin works in "Classic" mode, client/server mode, and with the
webui.  However, in the webui piece priority setting and display are
not yet supported.

## Piece Priorities

If you are using the gtkui you can easily set the priority of a piece
or a set of pieces by selecting them, right-click and set the
priority.

You can select multiple pieces in a few ways:  

* Click the first piece you want to select.  Hold Shift and click the last piece you want to select.  All pieces in between will be selected.  
* Clicking and dragging over the pieces you want to select  
* Holding Ctrl will start selecting pieces without unselecting the ones you have already selected  


Underneath all the pieces is a checkbox that will allow you to always
prioritize the first un-downloaded pieces of the torrent. This lets you
start watching a movie while it is still downloading. 


To install this plugin in deluge: go to edit, preferences, plugins,
install plugin and select the .egg file.
